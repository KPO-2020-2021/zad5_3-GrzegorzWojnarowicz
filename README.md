## Building

In main project folder create build directory, run `cmake ..` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.
Commands:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. 
> make 
> ./DRONE_run
```

for tests, go into build/tst directory and run command
```
> ./DRONE_tst  
```
