Build by making a build directory (i.\+e. {\ttfamily build/}), run {\ttfamily cmake ..} in that dir, and then use {\ttfamily make} to build the desired target. Example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> mkdir build \&\& cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{> cmake .. }
\DoxyCodeLine{> make }
\DoxyCodeLine{> ./DRONE\_SCENE\_tst  }
\DoxyCodeLine{> ./DRONE\_SCENE\_run}
\end{DoxyCode}
